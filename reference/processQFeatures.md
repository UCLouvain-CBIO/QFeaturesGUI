# Launch a Shiny application to process QFeatures objects

`processQFeatures()` launches an interactive Shiny application that
allows users to visually configure and apply pre-processing workflows to
a QFeatures object.

The input `qfeatures` can be provided either as an in-memory QFeatures
object or as a path to an `.rds` file containing one.

## Usage

``` r
processQFeatures(
  qfeatures,
  initialSets = seq_along(qfeatures),
  prefilledSteps = c("sample_filtering", "feature_filtering")
)
```

## Arguments

- qfeatures:

  A
  [QFeatures](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/QFeatures-class.html)
  object to be processed, or a character string specifying the path to a
  `.rds` file containing a
  [QFeatures](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/QFeatures/reference/QFeatures-class.html)
  object.

- initialSets:

  An integer, logical, or character vector specifying which assays
  (feature sets) should be used as the starting point for processing.
  Defaults to all assays in `qfeatures`.

- prefilledSteps:

  A character vector specifying the initial workflow steps to display
  when the application launches. Steps must be provided using their
  internal identifiers (e.g. `"sample_filtering"`,
  `"feature_filtering"`, `"normalisation"`).

## Value

The processQFeatures shiny application.

## Details

The application provides a drag-and-drop workflow builder that allows
users to select, order, and configure processing steps such as
filtering, normalization, and transformation. The configured workflow
can then be applied to the selected assays.
