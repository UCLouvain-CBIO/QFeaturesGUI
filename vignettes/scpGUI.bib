  abstract      = "Missing values are a notable challenge when analysing mass
                   spectrometry-based proteomics data. While the field is still
                   actively debating on the best practices, the challenge
                   increased with the emergence of mass spectrometry-based
                   single-cell proteomics and the dramatic increase in missing
                   values. A popular approach to deal with missing values is to
                   perform imputation. Imputation has several drawbacks for
                   which alternatives exist, but currently imputation is still
                   a practical solution widely adopted in single-cell
                   proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the
                   advantages and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5
                   main challenges linked to missing value management in
                   single-cell proteomics. Future developments should aim to
                   solve these challenges, whether it is through imputation or
                   data modelling. The perspective concludes with
                   recommendations for reporting missing values, for reporting
                   methods that deal with missing values and for proper
                   encoding of missing values.",
