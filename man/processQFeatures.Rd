\title{Launch a Shiny application to process QFeatures objects}
\usage{
processQFeatures(
  qfeatures,
  initialSets = seq_along(qfeatures),
  prefilledSteps = c("sample_filtering", "feature_filtering")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qfeatures}{A \linkS4class{QFeatures} object to be processed,
or a character string specifying the path to a \code{.rds} file
containing a \linkS4class{QFeatures} object.}

\item{initialSets}{An integer, logical, or character vector specifying
which assays (feature sets) should be used as the starting point for
processing. Defaults to all assays in \code{qfeatures}.}
}
\value{
The processQFeatures shiny application.
}
\description{
\code{processQFeatures()} launches an interactive Shiny application
that allows users to visually configure and apply pre-processing
workflows to a \linkS4class{QFeatures} object.

The input \code{qfeatures} can be provided either as an in-memory
\linkS4class{QFeatures} object or as a path to an \code{.rds} file
containing one.
}
\details{
The application provides a drag-and-drop workflow builder that allows
users to select, order, and configure processing steps such as filtering,
normalization, and transformation. The configured workflow can then be
applied to the selected assays.
