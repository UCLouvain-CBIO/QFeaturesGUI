# QFeaturesGUI

**QFeaturesGUI** is a collection of Shiny applications that provide
graphical user interfaces for MS-based proteomics data analysis using
the Bioconductor ecosystem. It supports both **bulk** and **single-cell
proteomics (SCP)** workflows and builds on the
[`QFeatures`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QFeatures.html)
and
[`scp`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scp.html)
packages.

Rather than a single application, QFeaturesGUI is composed of multiple
apps, each dedicated to a specific step of the proteomics data analysis
workflow.

## Features

- Graphical interfaces for MS-based proteomics data analysis
- Support for **bulk** and **single-cell proteomics**
- Native integration with `QFeatures` and `scp`
- Modular design with task-specific applications
- Built using **Shiny** and **shinydashboardPlus**

## Available applications

Currently available applications include:

- **Data import** (`importQFeatures`)  
  Import quantitative proteomics data into `QFeatures` objects

- **Data processing** (`processQFeatures`)  
  Perform common data processing steps on `QFeatures` and `scp` objects

Additional applications will be added in future releases.

## Installation

### Bioconductor (recommended)

``` r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("UCLouvain-CBIO/QFeaturesGUI")
